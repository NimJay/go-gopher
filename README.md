Go Gopher
===

The Go gopher is the mascot of the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/). The mascot was originally designed by [Renee French](http://reneefrench.blogspot.ca/).

This repository contains Nim's derivatives of the Go gopher.


## Instructions
To export the images (as PNGs) under custom dimensions, use the SVGs in the `svg/` folder. I recommend [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/).
